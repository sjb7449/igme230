<p id="verse1">The tide pool crumples like a woman<br/>
into the smallest version of herself,<br/>
bleeding onto whatever touches her.</p>

<p id="verse2">The ocean, I mean, not a woman, filled<br/>
with plastic lace, and closer to the vanishing<br/>
point, something brown breaks  the surface—human,</p>

<p id="verse3">maybe, a hand or foot or an island<br/>
of trash—but no, it’s just a garden of kelp.<br/>
A wild life.</p>

<p id="verse4">This is a prayer like the sea<br/>
urchin is a prayer, like the sea<br/>
star is a prayer, like the otter and cucumber—</p>

<p id="verse5">as if I know what prayer means.</p>

<p id="verse6">I call this the difficulty of the non-believer,<br/>
or, put another way, waking, every morning, without a god.</p>
