                    <h2>Goals/Audience</h2>
                    <p>My goal in this project was to create a website that focused around an interactive/animated infographic. The information displayed in the infographic would cover basic aspects of veganism. I went into this project with the intent of relaying this information to a young-adults audience, hoping to open their minds up to veganism and the positive impacts it has on the world and themselves.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
                    <p>I wanted my project to contain mainly icons, as I feel as though that is the primary tools used to communicate themes to young-adults now a days. I wanted the graphics featured on the screen to not feel patronizing, and I wanted to maintain a style of almost all clean, vector based icons.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Above and Beyond Explaination</h2>
                    <p>I searched through numerous websites in order to find useful graphical interaction tools. My website contains <b>four interactive sections</b> and the navigation utilizies JavaScript to <i>slide</i> the user down to the following sections. The <b><i>main splash page</i></b> contains a mouse-shape at the top. When the user hovers over any portion of the splash section, the mouse's scroller will flash to the user with the intention of indicating that one needs to scroll in order to access the website's content. When the website is accessed view a mobile device, the user can make the mouse flash-fade by clicking the splash section. My <b><i>second page</i></b>, which focuses on the environment, allows the user to click on icons to access more information about the subjects they pertain to. The <b><i>third portion</i></b>, which focuses on the bee population, has interactive bee images, which, once the user hovers over them, they will begin to wiggle/hover resembling the way a bee flies. When the user accesses the website via a mobile device, holding/tapping the bees makes them move. And my <b><i>fourth section</i></b> contains a slide show that the user can slide through to view images of animals. In class, we touched on the concepts needed to execute code such as this; however, with each section of my project (excluding the second page's interactions), I had to research how to complete the interactive graphics I wanted to feature. The sites I used to complete my project are featured in the <b>"Sources"</b> portion of this documentation page.</p>
